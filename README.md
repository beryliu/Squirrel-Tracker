# Squirrel-Tracker
This is the final project for IEOR 4501, tools for analytics. 

# Project Description
Thanks to the data provided by The Squirrel Census, we can conduct this Django-based web application, which aims to publicize the sightings of squirrels in Central Park.  This project used data solely in 2018, so the sightings may have a variation. 
This web application includes view sightings, add sightings, view through a map, and update or correct existing data.
